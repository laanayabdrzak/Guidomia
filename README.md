A simple app loading a list of cars from Local JSON file.

Mobile Practical Test (Ios) Objectives:

-  Develop a working mobile application
-  Use a git repo and share it, we want to see your commits

-  Please accomplish as many levels as you are comfortable with.
Do not proceed with the next level, until the current level is completely implemented.
