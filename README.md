# Guidomia
A simple app loading a list of cars from Local JSON file.

Mobile Practical Test (Ios) Objectives:

### Level 1:

-  Show a simple list of collapsed items
-  Extract the list information from the join json file.
-  Show a collapsed list (car image, name, price and rating) :

### Level 2:
-  Add the expandable section in the list.
-  By default, the first item should be expanded.
-  On clicking an item, the previous item will collapse, and the new item will expand.
-  Pros and cons sections should be shown.
-  Be aware there is no limit to the number of bullet point so these should be added dynamically.

### Level 3:
-  Implement the filters
-  Add a filter section in the UI
-  Create the two filter lists from the json provided: one for the make and one for the model
-  Show the result in the dropdown
-  On selecting a make or a model, the list should be updated following the filters

### Bonus level:
 - Pull the list once from the json then save the result in a local database. When reopening the app when data are saved, we should show these without pulling these from the json.
